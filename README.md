# httpd-experiments

HTTP server in multiple programming languages (as idiomatic as I can be as a noobie) in order to get started programming in that programming language.

Each http server should include the next features:

- Fully functional http server

- Documentation of all the functions

- Testing

- Simple ini style config file

- Use standard tools and coding style.
